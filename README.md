# 🚨 **Empty - Old Project from 2018** 🚨

---

## 👾 Introduction

Welcome to a **digital fossil** from 2018! Yes, this code is older than some internet memes, but don’t be fooled by its age—it *might* still have a few tricks up its sleeve. 

Built in the era of *primitive coding practices*, this project is like finding an ancient relic at the bottom of your code repository. But remember, just because it’s from 2018 doesn’t mean it’s *totally obsolete*—it’s just a little… “vintage” 😎.

Let’s just say this code has **character**, and by that, I mean **quirks**.

## ⚙️ Features (Or Should We Say "Time Capsules"?)

- **Clicker Madness**: If you like to spam clicks, this project is for you! It's as if the clicker button was a time machine—and *yes*, it can still be triggered.
- **Keybindings That Will Make You Question Your Life Choices**: We thought **hardcoding keys** was an innovative idea. Now, it’s a trip down memory lane.
- **Minecraft Window Detection**: Because who doesn’t want to create a tool that works specifically for *Minecraft* (it's not like there are other apps out there 😏)?
- **UI with Old-School Vibes**: A User Interface that’s as smooth as a *Windows XP startup*—don’t expect any fancy animations or 21st-century designs here!

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

Alright, brave soul, here’s how you can set this up:

1. Install **GLFW**, **OpenGL**, and **ImGui** (trust me, it’s a vibe).
2. Run this on **Windows** (Linux? Don’t even think about it).
3. Set up a **randomized clicker** (because clicking with a purpose is overrated).

If you manage to get this working, don’t say I didn’t warn you. It’s like operating an old-school joystick: *theoretically functional, but occasionally unpredictable*.

## 🧠 Code Overview

This project’s code might make you think, “What was I *really* thinking back then?” Here’s what you’ll find:

- **Main Code**: A nostalgic blend of C++ syntax and “let's try it and see if it works” attitude.
- **Mouse Hook**: We’ve got hooks for everything—probably too many hooks (like that one friend who invites you to everything). 
- **A Button That Sometimes Doesn’t Work**: Because, hey, no one’s perfect.

---

## 🐛 Known Bugs

- **Exit Button Might Quit on Its Own**: The **Exit** button works... when it feels like it. Kind of like that one coworker who says “I’ll finish that task later” and never does.
- **Clicker Overdrive**: It’s a clicker for when you *really* need to click something 500 times. Just maybe not all at once?

## 🎉 Conclusion

This project is like your favorite **retro video game**: a bit buggy, a bit outdated, but still *fun to play* for the nostalgic vibes. 

So, dust off your keyboard and give it a go—after all, we’re here for a good laugh, not perfection. 

Welcome to **2018**! The year of *coded chaos* and *slightly questionable design choices*.

## 📌 Final Words

- **Is it efficient?** Well, it’s efficient for 2018!
- **Is it pretty?** Like your favorite vintage sneakers: not perfect, but you love it anyway.

## 🙏 Special Thanks to **Lucas (aka Luqinhas)**

Big thanks to **[Lucas Morais (aka Six)](https://github.com/404six)** for introducing me to the weird and wonderful world of programming. If it weren’t for you, I’d never have created this *strange mess* of a project! So yeah, all this chaos? Totally your fault 😅.

Thanks, Lucas—you kicked off this **code madness** and there's no turning back! 🚀
